## UPDATE-001-quote-approval-500k-threshold (2026-10-06)
Instance: opmsalescrmstage
What: Advanced Approval Management (sn_adv_appr_mgmt) config for Quote
(sn_quote_mgmt_core_quote). Retuned the existing "Quote" Approval Configuration's
two trigger conditions/rules:
  - "All quote approvals" trigger condition → condition changed to `total_amount>=0`
    (fires for every quote, was previously >$100K). Rule renamed to "Quotes under
    $500K - Sales Manager approval only" (chain: Sales Manager approval, approver:
    Taylor Morgan — pre-existing wiring, unchanged).
  - "Deal Desk - Quote over $50K" trigger condition → renamed to "Deal Desk - Quote
    over $500K", threshold changed from $50,000 to $500,000. Rule renamed to "Quotes
    over $500K - Deal Desk approval (additional)" (chain: Deal Desk approval,
    approver: Marcus Reed — pre-existing wiring, unchanged).
Why: Requested approval policy — quotes under $500K need only Sales Manager sign-off;
quotes over $500K need Deal Desk approval in addition to Sales Manager.
No new Deal Desk approver user was created — Marcus Reed (Deal Desk Manager) already
existed on opmsalescrmstage, matching the persona used on opmsalescrm1.
Also granted the `sn_adv_appr_mgmt.approval_rule_writer` role to the admin service
account — required to write Approval Rule/Trigger Condition records, previously
missing.
Gotcha hit: running `execute`/`snow_execute` script calls while this Update Set was
current generated Scripted REST API/Resource/Version noise entries (the tool's
internal execution mechanism). These were deleted from the Update Set before export —
future captures should either avoid `snow_execute` while a demo Update Set is current,
or clean up the same way before exporting.
